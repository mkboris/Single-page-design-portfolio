## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5 markup** - Structured the content of the web page using meaningful and descriptive tags.
- **CSS custom properties** - Utilized for defining reusable variables for colors, fonts, and other styles.
- **Flexbox** - Used for aligning and distributing space among items in a container.
- **CSS Grid** - Employed for creating complex layouts with a grid-based design.
- **Mobile-first workflow** - Ensured the design and development prioritized mobile user experience.
- **SASS** - Leveraged for writing cleaner and more maintainable CSS using variables, nesting, and mixins.
- **Parcel** - Used for bundling and building the project assets.

### Continued development

I will try using a library like swiperjs when tackling a slider component next time.
